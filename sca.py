Station 1: The brief for the patient you will role play as. Remember to not volunteer too much information unless specifically asked. You directly answer the question and nothing further.

Opening line: “Doctor, it’s this chest pain, it’s niggling me.”

You are a woman in her mid 50s who has come in with chest pain for the past one week. It is diffuse pain across the centre of your chest, and you noticed it whilst working out on the elliptical trainer. You feel it is likely to be a muscle strain and you are wondering if you can get back to the gym. 

On direct questioning, you have noticed it does come on after fast walking as well as exercising. It isn’t affected by particular movements. You have noticed earlier in the week it came on after walking for 5 minutes, but now comes on after walking 1 or 2 minutes. You put this down to overtraining. The pain does not radiate, is 7/10 severity, improves with rest, is poorly localised and feels heavy. There is no postural/food relationship. There is no pleuritic component.

There is no shortness of breath, palpitations or LOC. 

You are generally well with no medical problems or medications. You have no allergies. Your father had a heart attack at your age and the thought of this will come flooding back if the doctor suggests anything to do with the heart. 

You work as an accountant and do not drink alcohol. You smoke 20 cigarettes per day since the age of 20. You live with your partner and 2 sons. 

Ideas, concerns and expectations: You think it is a muscle strain. You expect the doctor will advise you when to get back to the gym. 

You drove here and planned to drive to the hospital if asked. If pushed, your partner may be able to pop down to the surgery and take the car and drive you there.
